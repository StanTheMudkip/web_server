      <dl>
        <dd> I found that the hardest thing to combat during this assignment was my own memory. </dd>
        <dd> I spent like a day having troubles with getting the page layouts and dynamic templates to works. </dd>
        <dd> And sadly in reality all I had to do was remember something from the lectures. </dd>
        <dd> So when I rewatched the lectures it solved everrything, I forgot to change the defualt layout and stuff. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I learned a lot about how most websites interact with users and handle certain requests.  </dd>
        <dd> I learned a lot about how nice templates make things and how important they can be to reducing code clutter. </dd>
        <dd> I knew like none of this so I had no idea what I was doing until the lectures started.</dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I found the lecture recordings extremely useful because there were a lot of files to go through.</dd>
        <dd> That was basically all that I used. It was pretty strraight forward after the lectures... </dd>
        <dd> Its just remembering it all so that I can implement it properly lol. </dd>

      <dl>
        <dd> I was trying to work on this only after the first lecture so it was a bit hard. </dd>
        <dd> I read up on the resources provided, but didnt fully understand until the last lecture. </dd>
        <dd> I was able to print out the index.html, but learning that the other files will just be </dd>
        <dd> requested automatically was really nice, i thought it was going to be more complex. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I learned a lot about how websites are hosted and how the client and server interact. </dd>
        <dd> I was super lost at first, but after the last lecture I got a hang of it and now understand </dd>
        <dd> How the server communicates with ethe client and how the user receives them. I knew basically</dd>
        <dd> nothing before this. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I found the lecture notes and some of the wbesite resources provided.</dd>
        <dd> The websites helped me learn what puzzel pieces were out there, but the lecture helped me put it </dd>
        <dd> all together. </dd>

      <dl>
        <dd> The most challenging thing for me was getting search to work properly. </dd>
        <dd> I solved it by confusing myself with how querySelectorAll works and </dd>
        <dd> then realizing I should actually probably be using local variables as well. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I learned a lot of basics and stuff about js and how useful it is to websites. </dd>
        <dd> I learned how to manipulate the DOM instead of just hiding things which was useful. </dd>
        <dd> I didn't really know much prior because Its my first time really using js in a </dd>
        <dd> meaningful way. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> One thing I had to google was if there was a way to search for a subtring in a string </dd>
        <dd> so that I wouldn't have to write it from scratch. </dd>
        <dd> Another thing was how to create local variables because I found those very useful </dd>
        <dd> for how some of my functions were structured. </dd>

      <dl>
        <dd> WHat I found challenging about this assignment was being able to understand how to use </dd>
        <dd> inspect element to see the shape of all of the boxes and how to manipulate them.</dd>
        <dd> The most challenging part for me was getting the author to align porperly. </dd>
        <dd> I was able to solve this by using inspect element to see the size of each article. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I spent the previous week or two before looking into CSS, so some stuff was </dd>
        <dd> already familiar to me. The new stuff was mostly flex-boxes, fonts, and icons. </dd>
        <dd> I feel pretty proficiant with CSS now (atleast what we have done so far), its just </dd>
        <dd> A matter of remembering the settings that I can use to manipulate the html. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> One thing I had to google was how to get somehing on the page to the left of the screen. </dd>
        <dd> I learned that float and margin-left: auto; can help with this in certain situations. </dd>
        <dd> Another thing was how to get something to stick with the viewport (I started before the CSS lectures). </dd>
        <dd> It was actually pretty easy to do and I didn't need to really change anything else. </dd>

      <dl>
        <dd> I honestly didnt have much trouble or many challenges during this assignment. </dd>
        <dd> I was mostly just experementing with HTML and CSS and they seem pretty intuitive.</dd>
        <dd> The most challenging thing I encountered was finding the parts of tags in CSS that
             I wanted editted. </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> I have had a little bit of experience with html just with inspect element. </dd>
        <dd> So I have learned a lot about how everything is structured and viewed. </dd>
        <dd> I think getting a head start with CSS will help me a lot in the future (class wise). </dd>
        <br>
        <dd> For the most part I have just been following MDN's educational material. </dd>
        <dd> Since I started this before we actually started learning HTML in lecture,  </dd>
        <dd> MDN's articles and being able to view future lecture notes were increadibly helpful. </dd>
        <dd> I am preparing to dive into Java Script and see what that can empower me to do </dd>
