          <p>
            I was gifted an old server and installed proxmox to host my own virtual machines.
            I use it to run several game servers and try to get some more experience with linux.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have slowly been learning unity and c# for fun and experimenty with little projects.
            Such as a visual novel and a simple platformer.
            I would like to try and make my own FPS controller to try and replicate modern games.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have also been learning how to develop mobile applications with flutter,
            which I have had some experience with through my software engineering project.
            The project was to develope a hiking application for sharing hikes.
            I am also interested in learning react for mobile development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy playing video games such as minecraft, rainbow six siege, battlefield, and many more!
            I have also gotten into modding minecraft and am developing a potion/alchemy mod with  the
            forge mod development kit.
