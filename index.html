              As a part of my Operating Systems class I built a functioning shell called <a href="https://github.com/StanTheMudkip/CS344-Ass3" class="link"> smallsh</a>.
              It can be executed from within an existing bash terminal. It can parse input from the user,
              execute built in bash commands via forking and executing processes, can run commands in
              the background and clean up finished proceses, it can also expand the $$ into the process ID of the shell.

          <p class="hobby">
            I was gifted an old server and installed proxmox to host my own virtual machines.
            I use it to run several game servers and try to get some more experience with linux.
          </p>

          <p class="hobby">
            I have slowly been learning unity and C# for fun and experimentation with little projects.
            Such as a visual novel and a simple platformer.
            I would like to try and make my own FPS controller to try and replicate modern games.
          </p>

          <p class="hobby">
            I have been learning how to develop mobile applications with flutter,
            which I have had some experience with through my software engineering project.
            The project was to develope a hiking application for sharing hikes.
            I am also interested in learning react for mobile development.
          </p>

          <p class="hobby">
            I enjoy playing video games such as minecraft, rainbow six siege, battlefield, and many more!
            I have gotten into modding minecraft and am developing a potion/alchemy mod with  the
            forge mod development kit.
